abstract="When computing descriptors of image data, the type of information that can be extracted may be strongly dependent on the scales at which the image operators are applied. This article presents a systematic methodology for addressing this problem. A mechanism is presented for automatic selection of scale levels when detecting one-dimensional image features, such as edges and ridges.",

abstract="This article shows how discrete derivative approximations can be defined so thatscale-space properties hold exactly also in the discrete domain. Starting from a set of natural requirements on the first processing stages of a visual system,the visual front end, it gives an axiomatic derivation of how a multiscale representation of derivative approximations can be constructed from a discrete signal, so that it possesses analgebraic structure similar to that possessed by the derivatives of the traditional scale-space representation in the continuous domain. A family of kernels is derived that constitutediscrete analogues to the continuous Gaussian derivatives.",

abstract={A manner in which a notion of effective scale can be introduced in a formal way is developed. For continuous signals, a scaling argument directly gives a natural unit for measuring scale-space lifetime in terms of the logarithm of the ordinary scale parameter. That approach is, however, not appropriate for discrete signals since an infinite lifetime would be assigned to structures existing in the original signal. It is shown how such an effective scale parameter can be defined to give consistent results for both discrete and continuous signals. The treatment is based on the assumption that the probability that a local extremum disappears during a short-scale interval should not vary with scale. As a tool for the analysis, estimates are given of how the density of local extrema can be expected to vary with scale in the scale-space representation of different random noise signals both in the continuous and discrete cases},

abstract={We propose optimal gradient operators based on a newly derived consistency criterion. This criterion is based on an orthogonal decomposition of the difference between a continuous gradient and discrete gradients into the intrinsic smoothing effect and the self-inconsistency involved in the operator. We show that consistency assures the exactness of gradient direction of a locally 1D pattern in spite of its orientation, spectral composition, and sub-pixel translation. Stressing that inconsistency reduction is of primary importance, we derive an iterative algorithm which leads to accurate gradient operators of arbitrary size. We compute the optimum 3×3, 4×4, and 5×5 operators, compare them with conventional operators and examine the performance for one synthetic and several real images. The results indicate that the proposed operators are superior with respect to accuracy, bandwidth and isotropy},
